            I'm a dedicated computer science student with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my degree, where I've developed a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development. Outside of academics, I love working on personal coding projects and exploring the latest trends in tech.
